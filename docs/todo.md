- [ ] Go through current shaders and stop importing everything, instead only import what is needed. Make sure everything in the library works.
- [ ] Save and use pictures for textures
- [ ] Find more models
- [ ] Split up shader texture patterns from shader shapes
- [ ] Find more shapes to use
- [ ] Play with more shapes
- [ ] Organize shaders that are ready for a song into the final directory -> maybe choose another name
- [ ] Think about how I want to start for tomorrow night. What would I do. What would I need.
- [ ] Interactions of Color
- [ ] Smoke
- [ ] mymsss
- [ ] go through each shader and look for 00-common etc imports

- [ ] concerns about zonnestral.glsl functions -> my_mix, sind, cosd, added, ect. should split these out to their own glsl files
- [ ] every function should be in its own file, then if a shader needs to use it, they just import it. or if it needs to change, the shader can copy it and rename it. Need a naming convention. This will likely occuring during live coding.

- [ ] zonnestral and impact are the same shader
- [ ] each song should not have any code besides the glsl file it is calling? Do we like that? not sure, but need to be consistent.  Maybe split finished shaders into a `finished`/`final`. those are all glsl files. then sets/songs can call into them? Pros? Cons?
- [ ] archive directory where all shaders go that have been given a real name. so if ridge-20 is renamed to something else? how to keep track of this?
- [ ] start taking screen shots and build a catalog? will that just slow me down? 
- [ ] my brother louie isnt quite the brother louie that i want :/ need to go back in git commits and find it

- [ ] search for ifndef UNIFORMS and delete
- [ ] review sayin-sayin set cuz some of them are fire (`sayin_sayin_blue_wiggly_clock_og`'s)
- [ ] i think i actually need to split out `sayin_sayin` shaders to multiple files like couch or ridge. this is contrary to what ive been thinking lately (wanting to consolidate sets into a single file), but this gets messy and confusing and i accidentally end up editing the wrong function.


- [ ] noise functions https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4dS3Wd
- [ ] move rotate functions from pxl into common
- [ ] wood-bb.glsl is fucked - fix it
- [ ] fucking fix pb2yk :/
