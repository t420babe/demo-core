# 2020.12.28 Retro Mirror
I was googling around for a cheetah print algorithm when I stumbled upon [this website]().
Found it through pinterest actually. I never click on those normally since pinterest is such a hellscape.
I clicked on a few of his shaders.
Initially I was going to go for the wavy one, until I found the plasma one.
It just stood out as being so pretty.

So I copied it over and started playing with it.
At first I ... go through each plasma function

Then I got the retro mirror.
It was kinda tilted at first.
But then I was playing with it some more and when I add the line `uv = uv.xx`, the lines become straight how I want them. 
I don't know why though.
